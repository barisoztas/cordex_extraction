# Data Extraction from Climate Models (CMIP5 - CORDEX - CMIP6)  
Prepared by Baris Oztas for TUBÄ°TAK 2232 Project called "Climate change effects on trophic structure and dynamics in saline and brackish water based on a space-for-time field sampling, controlled mesocosm experiments, paleoecology, remote sensing and modelling (CLIM-SALTLAKES)"  
A simple and fast way for extraction cordex data just using rlat and rlon info of desired location.
